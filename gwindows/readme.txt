Abstract
========

GWindows is a full Microsoft Windows Rapid Application Development

The framework includes ADO database and Active X support.

Status
======

GWindows is sucessfuly being used by individuals and companies
world wide for the development of professional Windows (32 and 64 bit)
products.

Please joint the e-mail list gnavi-list@gnavi.org if you are experiencing
any problems or have suggestions for improvements.

Documentation
=============

In the "docs" directory there is a user_guide in Word format
(html available on the web) and a quick reference text.

Installation
============

All you have is to run the setup program (e.g. GWindows Setup 16-Feb-2012.exe
downloaded from here http://sf.net/projects/gnavi/files/latest/download ).
So normally, if you read this readme.txt document, that step already happened!
The setup program offers you to choose either the ANSI or Unicode variant of
GWindows. You can change that choice any time by running, in the gwindows folder,
ansi.cmd or unicode.cmd. You can also install GWindows at two or more places.

What's New in GWindows 1.3 and later versions
=============================================
