Abstract
========

GWindows is a full Microsoft Windows Rapid Application Development
framework for programming GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) with Ada.
The framework includes ADO database and Active X support.

Status
======

GWindows is successfuly being used by individuals and companies
world wide for the development of professional Windows (32 and 64 bit)
products.

Please joint the e-mail list gnavi-list@gnavi.org if you are experiencing
any problems or have suggestions for improvements.

Documentation
=============

In the "docs" directory there is a user guide in Word format
(HTML available as well), and a quick reference text.

Installation
============

The most you have to do is to run the setup program (e.g. GWindows 11-Nov-2017.exe
downloaded from there: http://sf.net/projects/gnavi/files/latest/download ) which
unpacks a copy of the GWindows and GNATCOM frameworks with samples, tutorials and
other goodies. But GWindows doesn't require any installation beyond getting a local
copy of the frameworks' Ada sources.
Alternatively you can:
  - retrieve a copy of the SVN repository from http://sf.net/p/gnavi/code/ .
  - pull a copy of the Git repository from https://github.com/svn2github/gnavi .

So normally, if you read this readme.txt document, installation already happened!
The setup program offers you to choose either the ANSI or Unicode variant of
GWindows. You can change that choice any time by running, in the gwindows folder,
ansi.cmd or unicode.cmd. You can also install GWindows at one, two or more places.

What's New in GWindows 1.3 and later versions
