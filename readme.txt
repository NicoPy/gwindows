GNAVI
=====

The GNAVI project's goal is an integrated, interactive development
environment. That software so far unfinished.

However, the underlying programming framework for Windows, GWindows,
is fully functional and used for many years in professional, commercial,
or open-source applications. GWindows is updated regularly.

For graphical interface development, an alternative to GNAVI is
the combination of a resource editor (for instance the freeware ResEdit
@ http://www.resedit.net ) for editing resource scripts (.rc files),
and GWenerator, that translates a .rc file into Ada files that use GWindows.

For more information, read the other "readme"'s, mainly:

  gwindows\readme.txt              -  for the GWindows framework
  gwenerator\gwenerator_info.html  -  for the GWenerator code generator
  gnatcom\readme.txt               -  for the GNATCOM framework
