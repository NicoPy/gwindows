GNAVI
=====

The GNAVI project is an integrated, interactive development
environment that is so far unfinished.

However, the underlying programming framework for Windows, GWindows,
is fully functional and used for many years in professionnal, commercial,
or open-source applications. GWindows is updated regularily.

For graphical interface developement, an alternative to GNAVI is
the combination of a resource editor (for instance the freeware ResEdit
@ http://www.resedit.net ) for editing resource scripts (.rc files),
and GWenerator, that translates a .rc file into Ada files that use GWindows.
